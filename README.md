# RayCastingUpdated

This program was built using SFML and C++, and my own SFAS (an addon to SFML) librarys

If you can get it to build successfully congrats.
I used SFML 3.0.0 a snapshot vershot verson, as currently fully released versions don't work on apple sillicon

Controls:

  Arrow keys to look around and move forward/back
  To build a wall, first select wanted texture from the texture window, then go to the little minimap (bottom right) and 
  hold down 'Q' this will be the start point, move the mouse to where you want the end point of the wall to be and let go of 'Q'.

  The slider adjusts your height (just kinda looks cool).T

  he input feild above the 'Connect' button is where you put the IP 
  of the server if you want to do that.
